                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p><strong>SMART says a lot about the way we approach things at Haffenden Communications, not just
                    in terms of the project management methodology we use – That our approach to all tasks and
                    projects always be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely.</strong> That goes without
                    saying. But for every communications challenge it is always SMART to start by asking the right
                    questions to ensure that the project outcome provides the right answers to help your customers to
                    continually improve patient care.</p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Specific</strong> – What does your clinical data say and how to we ensure that patients benefit from your customers hearing about it?</li>
                        <li><strong>Measurable</strong> – Does attending an accredited educational event give a physician more than just points? Can we track the impact of participation by seeing actual changes in patient care at the clinical level?</li>
                        <li><strong>Achievable</strong> – Is there more value in “ten” stand-alone communications initiatives than "one" integrated educational program? Does the media chosen provide the right learning environment? Will the right customers hear the right message?</li>
                        <li><strong>Realistic</strong> – Are your messages clinically relevant? What regulatory and legal restrictions will affect both the way physicians are allowed to practice and/or the way we provide them with information? Is this different to elsewhere in the region/world?</li>
                        <li><strong>Timely</strong> – How much “noise” is out there in the competitive environment? How do we ensure that the right audience hears your message at the right time over the banter of your competitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Offering medical education strategic support, from publications planing and materials review through to advocacy development to assist you in implementing an integrated program of communication initiatives to provide consistent and clinically relevant information to your customers.</p>
                    <p>That’s why selecting the right scientific communications partner is crucial to maximising your communication opportunities. While for us scientific integrity, creativity and delivery excellence are bywords for success, our SMART approach to partnering with your organisation will create the right chemistry for effective communication with your customers in a way that is… specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and always timely.</p>
